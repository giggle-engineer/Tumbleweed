I made this primarily as a way for me to get more familiar with Swift but if you find this useful or interesting then by all means go ahead and contribute. It's still a huge work in progress and many things are missing or aren't completed. For instance some huge architectural changes need to be made to even be able to view someone's blog inline or your own likes. You can view and like photo posts (not photosets) though!
